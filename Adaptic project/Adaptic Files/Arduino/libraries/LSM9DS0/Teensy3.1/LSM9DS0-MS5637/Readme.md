Basic unified sketch to configure the LSM9DS0 and MS5637, get scaled accel/gyro/mag/pressure/temperature data out and use open-sourcer sensor fusion to produce quaternions and AHRS yaw, pitch and roll.

Does the same as Jim Lindblom's Sparkfun library but in a single and, IMHO, easier to understand format.
